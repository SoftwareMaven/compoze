compoze TOODs
=============

- [X] Break monolithic command (version 0.1) into subcommands, and make
      them pluggable via entry points.

- [X] Fix the ``compoze show`` command to get real values from PyPI.

      * Unit tests mock it away too well.

- [X] Allow use of a a config file for setting defaults:
 
      * ``verbose``

      * ``index-url``

      * ``find-links``

      * ``fetch-site-packages``

      * ``include-binary-eggs``

      * ``keep-tempdir``

- [_] Add a '--versions-file' argument to the ``compoze show`` and
      ``compoze fetch`` commands:  this should allow us to solve the
      problem of managing muliple overlapping indexes, using something
      like the ``versions.cfg`` file used by ``zc.buildout``.

      o Should it just be an INI file with a ``[versions]`` section?
        Or some other format, like the ``requiremnts.txt`` files used by
        ``pip``?

- [_] Add an 'install' command, which does like 'easy_install' but
      with the following differences:

      o it is willing to check multiple indexes

      o it records the index from which each package was downloaded
        somewhere (do we care?)

- [_] Add an 'upgrade' command, which checks all installed packages
      in the working set against the specified (or configured) indexes).
