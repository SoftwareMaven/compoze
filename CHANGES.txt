repoze.project Changelog

  repoze-project 0.0.4 (2007-10-24)

    - Depend on virtualenv >= 0.9.1 (so people who use Mac framework
      builds and already have an earlier non-working one installed are
      warned).

  repoze-project 0.0.3 (2007-10-22)

    - Change entry point group to 'repoze.project', use 'initialize'
      entry point name to find entry point.

    - More carefully specify requirement name for repoze.project
      so we always require the version in use by the parent Python.

    - Change '--target-path' option to '--path' for easier remembering.

  repoze-project 0.0.2 (2007-10-20)

    - Use entry points to initialize environment after installing eggs.

  repoze-project 0.0.1 (2007-10-19)

    - Initial pre-alpha release.
